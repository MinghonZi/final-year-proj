\begin{frame}{Objectives}

The main objective of this project is to train a collision avoidance policy by a DRL algorithm without map information to navigate from the starting position to desired goal without running into obstacles in unknown cluttered indoor environments.

\bigskip

The policy takes as input the transform from robot frame to goal frame, the odometry data from wheel encoders, and data from LiDAR. In exchange, the policy outputs velocity commands which sent to the base controller of the robot.

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
   \item Specific: I think yes.
   \item Measurable: The robot can reach the goal at least once.
   \item Achievable: I have resources and skills needed to complete.
   \item Relevant: It's a robotics project.
   \item Time-bound: By the end of the FYP.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Non-Goals}

The policy is safe.

\bigskip

The policy is robust.

\bigskip

The policy has well generalisation properties.

\bigskip

The policy is applicable to outdoor environments.
