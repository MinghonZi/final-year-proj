\section{Results}

DDPG and TD3 have been implemented and tested in Gym classic control and MuJoCo envs.

A simulated navigation training based on DDPG has been completed, but the performance was very poor due to frequent performance droping which is a limitation of DDPG. SAC, the successor to DDPG, adds three tricks to mitigate this limitation, and it is hoped that SAC will lead to better results for this project.
