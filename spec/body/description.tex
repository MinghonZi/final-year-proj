\section{Project Description}

The main objective of this project is to train an optimal policy for navigating a mobile robot to a desired target position with obstacle avoidance by deep reinforement learning in a simulated indoor environment full of obstacles. Four weeks before the end of the first semester, the robot is expected to be able to move to the target on a level ground with no obstacles. Before the end of semester one, it is expected that the robot can reach the target with obstacles. By the end of the project, the robot would be able to reach the target in unseen environment.
