\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}

This project aimed to develop a DRL-based motion planner for a wheeled robot to navigate indoor without the use of a map. A DRL library was implemented, consisting of three SOTA algorithms: DDPG, TD3, and SAC. Integration tests for all algorithms were conducted on the MuJoCo locomotion control training environments to ensure their valid implementation. The algorithms were then applied to train policies for mapless navigation in simulated environments. The performance of trained policies was recorded as video and can be accessed through the project's GitHub repository.

Throughout the course of the project, several challenges were identified, including partial observability, sparse reward, transfer learning, and catastrophic forgetting. These challenges highlight the current limitations of DRL in robotic applications and provide opportunities for further research and improvement.

The project also provided valuable learning experiences. The reflection offers insights into areas for improvement in future research projects.

In conclusion, this project has successfully demonstrated the application of DRL for mapless navigation in a wheeled robot. The implementation of the DRL library and the training environment, coupled with the insights gained from experiments, establish a solid foundation for further research and exploration in the field of robotics and DRL.
