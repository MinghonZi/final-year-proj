% Abstract
\textbf{Abstract}
\begin{spacing}{0.95}
\parbox{0.83\textwidth}{
This project explores state-of-the-art model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and their application to two-dimensional navigation tasks without the use of mapping techniques. While this approach does not provide theoretical guarantees for success rate or generalisation ability, it showcases the versatility of DRL and its potential for robotics. To facilitate research, the project includes the development of a Python library for implementing and testing DRL algorithms. The library has been tested on various simplistic training environments for validating the algorithm implementation. The project includes recorded videos on testing and training and a demonstration program for mapless navigation. While mapless navigation remains a challenging problem, this project demonstrates the potential of DRL and offers a foundation for future research of applying DRL to robotic tasks.
